Internship Report: Power BI Dashboard Projects

Introduction During my internship, I worked on creating interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize and analyze Twitter data. These dashboards aimed to provide insights into tweet interactions, engagement metrics, and media performance.

Task 1: Clustered Bar Chart for Interaction Types

Project Overview • Objective: Create a clustered bar chart showing the sum of URL clicks, user profile clicks, and hashtag clicks by tweet category. • Data Source: Twitter data with interaction metrics. • Time Filter: 3 PM to 6 PM. • Additional Criteria: o Even tweet dates. o Tweet word count below 40. Approach

Gather data on tweet interactions (URL clicks, profile clicks, and hashtag clicks).
Categorize tweets based on content (e.g., media, links, hashtags).
Calculate the sum of interactions for each tweet category.
Create a clustered bar chart with three bars representing each interaction type.
Task 2: Top 10 Tweets by Retweets and Likes

Project Overview

• Objective: Identify the top 10 tweets based on retweets and likes. • Data Source: Twitter engagement data. • Time Filter: 3 PM to 6 PM. • Additional Criteria: o Exclude tweets posted on weekends. o Odd tweet dates. o Tweet word count below 30. Approach

Calculate the total engagement (retweets + likes) for each tweet.
Filter out weekend tweets.
Select the top 10 tweets based on engagement.
Display the user profiles associated with these top tweets.
Task 3: Visualization for Media Engagements

Project Overview • Objective: Compare replies, retweets, and likes for tweets with media engagements above the median value. • Data Source: Twitter data with media views and engagement metrics. • Time Filter: 3 PM to 6 PM. • Additional Criteria: o Tweets posted between June and August 2020. o Odd tweet dates. o Even media views. o Tweet word count below 50. Approach

Calculate the median value for media engagements.
Filter tweets within the specified timeframe.
Create a visualization (e.g., bar chart) comparing engagement metrics.
Conclusion My internship experience with Power BI allowed me to apply data visualization techniques to real-world social media data. I gained valuable insights into tweet interactions, engagement patterns, and media performance.
